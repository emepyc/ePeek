# TnT
TnT is a javascript library for displaying trees and associated track-based annotations. It is built on top of [TnT Tree](http://emepyc.github.io/tnt.tree/) and [TnT Board](http://emepyc.github.io/tnt.board/). It has been designed with a powerful [API](http://emepyc.github.io/tnt/api/index.html), written with flexibility in mind, that allows the creation of expressive, dynamic and powerful tree and track-based visualisations.
