<h2>Trees</h2>
<p><i>tnt.tree</i> creates a new tree visualization. There are several components that need to be set up in this visualization. One is the tree object to display (<i>tnt.tree.data</i> method). You can obtain a valid tree object directly from <i>newick</i> or <i>nhx</i> formats through <i>tnt.tree.parse_newick</i> or <i>tnt.tree.parse_nhx</i> respectively, or you can pass a javascript object with a tree structure. TnT converts this tree object into a <i>tnt.tree.tree</i> object to allow some tree manipulation methods to be used on the tree structure. For example:</p>

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var newick = '((human, chimp),mouse)';
var tree_vis = tnt.tree()
              .data(tnt.tree.parse_newick(newick));
var tree = tree.tree();
var tree_object = tree.data();
{% endhighlight %}

<p>In the snippet above, <i>tree_vis</i> is the tree visualization object, <i>tree</i> is a tree object with different methods on nodes to search, apply, etc... and tree_object is a pure javascript object representing the tree. See below for all the methods available for each type of object (expect for tree_objects which are pure</p>
