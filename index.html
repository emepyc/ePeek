<p><b>TnT</b> is a javascript library for displaying trees and track-based annotations in any web document. It has been designed with a powerful API that allows the creation of expressive and dynamic tree and annotation visualizations with a few lines of javascript code. You only need to insert a few lines in your page and let the plug-in do the rest</p>
<p>See <a href={{ page.baseurl }}/themes/index.html>more examples</a></p>
<p>Check out the <a href={{ page.baseurl }}/doc/api/index.html>Documentation</a></p>

<h2><a name="introduction" href="#introduction">#</a>Introduction</h2>
<p>The TnT plug-in consists of two components. The TnT core plug-in where the main functionalities of the plug-in are defined and a TnT <i>theme</i> that defines the actual view of your tree and how to interact with it. Although this may seem very abstract, it is in practice very simple, and converts TnT into a very powerful and customizable plug-in.
<p>The easiest way to embed TnT in your site is by using one of the distributed <i>themes</i>. The general pattern of a theme looks something likes this:</p>

{% highlight html linenos %}
<script src="http://emepyc.github.io/tnt/v1/tnt.min.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<script src="http://emepyc.github.io/tnt/v1/themes/compact.min.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var t = tnt.tree().width(620); // other methods can be included here
var theme = tnt_theme(); // other methods can be included here
theme (t, document.getElementById('DOM_element_id');
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The two lines of the first block link with the TnT core library and one of the pre-defined themes respectively.
  The first line of the second block gets the tnt object. This object is configurable via a set of methods. All these methods are explained in the library <a href={{ page.baseurl }}/doc/api/index.html>API documentation</a> and the most important ones are explained below</p>
<p>A theme object is obtained in line #3. This object can also be configured with its own set of methods.</p>
<p>This theme object is itself a <i>closure</i> or code reference, that can be called with two parameters, the first one is the ePeek object and the other one is a DOM element (normally a <i>div</i> element).
