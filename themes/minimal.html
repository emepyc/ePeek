<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This theme just shows the basics for displaying trees with TnT. The source code for this theme is just:</p>

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var tnt_theme = function () {

    // The tree to plot
    var newick = '...';  // Omitted

    var theme = function (t, div) {
        t
            .data (tnt.tree.parse_newick(newick))
            .layout (tnt.tree.layout.vertical()
                     .width(650)
                    )
            .label (tnt.tree.label.text()
                    .height(15)
                   );
        t(div);
    };

    return theme;
};
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The theme first defines a top level function called <i>tnt_theme</i> that encapsulates the functionality needed by the theme. Inside it, we normally define a closure that accepts two arguments, at TnT object and a div element. This closure is the only thing returned by the theme. An example of use would be something like:</p>

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var tree = tnt.tree();
var theme = tnt_theme();
theme (tree, document.getElementById(div_id));
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This example is not very interesting since the tree is hardcoded in the theme and the tree doesn't interact with us in any sense. In the next examples, different ways of making more interesting trees will be shown</p>
